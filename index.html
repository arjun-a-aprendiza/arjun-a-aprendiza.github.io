          Well hello there! My name is Cassidy and I'm a Director of Developer
          Experience at

            >Netlify</a
          >. Before now, I worked at React Training, CodePen, Amazon, L4
          Digital, Clarifai, and Venmo, and graduated from Iowa State
          University. <br />
          I run
          <a href="http://cassidoo.co/newsletter">a weekly newsletter</a> and
          love teaching and helping people become better coders! In my spare
          time, I love playing music, building mechanical keyboards and LEGO
          sets, and hanging out with
          <a href="https://twitter.com/cwillycs">my sister Cami</a>. I also have
          a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/cassidoo">Patreon</a> if you'd like
          to chat with me regularly (our Discord group is so active I can hardly
          keep up!), get resume reviews, schedule mock interviews with me, or
          just play video games. No pressure to join in, and I appreciate your
          support a ton no matter what! <br />
          In terms of where I am on the internet (and off), you might have seen
          me in

            >Kickstarter project called Go: On the Go!</a
          >
          to get people interested in playing the game Go. I've spoken at over a
          hundred events around the world, and have made online classes on
          <a href="https://scrimba.com/teachers/cassidoo">Scrimba</a>,

          or do influencer work for your org. I have a
          <a href="https://cass.run/rider">speaker rider</a>, if you'd like to
          talk to me about your event. Feel free to
          <a href="mailto:cassidy@cassidoo.co">email me</a> with details! <br />
          Alright, since you've read this far, have a joke: Why are mountains so
          funny? Because they're hill areas.

          Cassidy is Director of Developer Experience at Netlify. She's worked
          for several other places, large and small, and she's had the honor of
          working with various non-profits, including cKeys and Hacker Fund as
          their Director of Outreach. She's active in the developer community,
          and one of Glamour Magazine's 35 Women Under 35 Changing the Tech
          Industry and LinkedIn's Top Professionals 35 &amp; Under. As an avid
          speaker, Cassidy has participated in many events including the Grace
          Hopper Celebration for Women in Computing, TEDx, the United Nations,
          and hundreds of other technical events. She wants to inspire
          generations of STEM students to be the best they can be, and her
          favorite quote is from Helen Keller: "One can never consent to creep
          when one feels an impulse to soar." She loves mechanical keyboards and
          karaoke.
